# Module_10_Challenge

Proposing an approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies.

First we import and prepare the data. 
Used K-Means algorithm with the best value for k in order to cluster the cryptocurrencies.
Then we find the best value of k using the original data with an elbow curve. 
Optimized cluters with PCA and reduceed the features to three principal components.
Find the best value of k using the PCA data with an elbow curve again.
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means using the PCA Data
Visualized and compared the results by using the composite plot using hvPlot and plus operator
